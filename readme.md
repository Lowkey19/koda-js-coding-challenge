**What we are looking for through this challenge:**

- Functionality
- Code Format
- Project Structure

- Use of industry best practices

## Goals

Implement the screens based on the wireframes and api below using advanced techniques and industry best practices for your platform. Note that the wireframes may not be complete, so use your best judgment for UI/UX implementation. **Do not use a boilerplate like React Boilerplate for this challenge.** We want to see how you structure your project and what tooling you use from scratch. Create react app is fine to use.
